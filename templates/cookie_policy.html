        <h2 class="content-subtitle">1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>LeaveFlow uses cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Authentication (Essential Cookies):</strong> We use cookies to identify you when you visit our website and as you navigate our website. The primary cookie we use is a "session cookie" which is essential for you to stay logged in as you move between pages. This cookie is deleted when you close your browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Security:</strong> We may use cookies as an element of the security measures used to protect user accounts, including preventing fraudulent use of login credentials, and to protect our website and services generally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flash Messages:</strong> We use a cookie to store flash messages (like "Login successful" or "Leave applied") so they can be displayed on the next page you visit.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use cookies for advertising, tracking your activity across other websites, or analytics purposes.</p>

        <h2 class="content-subtitle">3. Managing Cookies</h2>
        <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aboutcookies.org</a>. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
